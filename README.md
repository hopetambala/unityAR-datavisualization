# AR in React

## Development

This project is built with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Viro Media](https://github.com/viromedia/viro)

Here are some quick commands to get started:

- `npm install`: Install Node dependencies
- `npm start`: Start the hot reloading development server.


## Troubleshooting

### nGrok

If you do not see the ngrok address in your terminal, open a new tab, navigate to your workspace and then run

```
./node_modules/react-viro/bin/run_ngrok.sh
```

Or, from your browser, navigate to:

[http://localhost:4040/status](http://localhost:4040/status)

If ngrok isn't already running, you can start it by running the follow command in your terminal (anywhere should work):
```
ngrok http 8081
```
